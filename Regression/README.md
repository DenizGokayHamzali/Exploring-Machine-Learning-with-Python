# Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

The goal of this project is to use linear regression to predict house prices based on a dataset of various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, and location. 

The dataset used in this project contains two CSV files: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv file is used to train the model, while the test.csv file is used to test the accuracy of the model.

## Conclusion

The linear regression model is a simple yet powerful technique for predicting house prices based on various features. 

By understanding the correlations between the features and the target variable, we can gain insights into what factors influence house prices and make more informed decisions in the real estate market.
