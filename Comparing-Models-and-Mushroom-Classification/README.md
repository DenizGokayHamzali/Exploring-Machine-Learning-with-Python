# Mushroom Classification using Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics.

The dataset used in this project contains a CSV file named mushroom.csv. The file contains various features such as the cap shape, cap color, ring number, and ring type.

## Conclusion

I explored the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, and Random Forest for classification of mushrooms based on their physical characteristics.

By understanding the correlations between the features and the target variable, we can gain insights into what characteristics make a mushroom edible or poisonous.
