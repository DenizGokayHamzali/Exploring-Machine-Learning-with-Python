# Clustering Live Selling Products based on Reactions and Engagement

The goal of this project is to cluster live selling products based on customer reactions ang engagement, such as the number of comments and shares to a Meta (formerly Facebook) post.

The dataset used in this project contains one CSV file: Live.csv, obtained from machine learning repository of University of California Irvine. Each row represents a product, and there are a total of 13 features, including customer reactions and engagement metrics.

## Conclusion

Using KMeans clustering, I was able to group live selling products into four distinct clusters based on customer engagement and reaction metrics. 

By analizing the mean number of comments and shares for each cluster, we can gain insights into customer preferences and make informed decisions about product promotion and advertising.
