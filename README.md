# Exploring Machine Learning with Python: A Collection of Guided Projects using Various Algorithms

There are several projects in this repository that utilize different machine learning algorithms to solve different problems. 

Each project is stored in a separate folder, and has its own README file with details about the dataset used, the algorithm(s) applied, and conclusion part.

"This repository contains the guided projects that I have completed within the scope of the courses I took from Global AI Hub. I have used the resources provided by Global AI Hub."
