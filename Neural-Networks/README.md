# Multilayer Perceptron Classifier for MNIST Dataset

The goal of this project is to use a multilayer perceptron classifier to classify the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which is collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset has 70000 images, and I used 49000 images for training and 21000 images for testing.

## Conclusion

Multilayer perceptron classifier is a powerful technique for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. By changing the number of hidden layers in the model, we can observe how the performance of the model changes.
