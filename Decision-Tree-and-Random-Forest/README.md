# Predicting Titanic Survivors using Decision Trees and Random Forests

The goal of this project is to predict survivors of the Titanic disasater using Decision Trees and Random Forests. The dataset used in this project is a CSV file called DecisionTrees_titanic.csv.

## Conclusion

Both Decision Trees and Random Forests are powerful techniques for predicting Titanic survivors based on various features.

By understanding the correlations between the features and the target variable, we can gain insights into what factors influenced a passenger's survival and make more informed decisions in the event of a similar disaster.
