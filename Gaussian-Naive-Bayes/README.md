# Predicting Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Gaussian Naive Bayes

The goal of this project is to use the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on various features such as the radius, texture, and perimeter.

The dataset used in this project is breast-cancer.csv, which contains the features and diagnosis (Malignant/Benign) for each instance. I have used label encoding to convert the diagnosis column to numeric values.

## Conclusion

The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple yet effective technique for predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer based on various features. By using this algorithm, we can gain insights into what features are most important for predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer and make more informed decisions in the healthcare industry.
